/*
Fibonacci, was an Italian mathematician who came up with the Fibonacci sequence:
0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144,......
Where every number after the first two is the sum of the two proceeding ones.

e.g. 0+1 = 1
1+1 = 2
1+2 = 3
2+3 = 5

etc.

Create a function you can call by writing the code:
fibonacciGenerator (n);

Where n is the number of items in the sequence.
So I should be able to call:

fibonacciGenerator(3) and fibonacciGenerator
[0,1,1]
as the output.

for (var i=1; i<2; i++){
  do something
}

for (variable created with value 1; checks if variable i is smaller than 2; increments variable i)

*/

function fibonacciGenerator (n) {
  //TODO

  //Return an array of fibonacci numbers.
}
